The emerald Rosé Pine rice for Hyprland is a pre-made set of customizations for all of my personal favorite tools that I use for my daily driver. 

These dotfiles include configurations for the following:

- Hyprland
- waybar
- Rofi
- Kvantum

Of course this will be constantly updated whenever I change something about my rice on my personal setup for it, but this is where you can go to find all of those changes! I hope you enjoy this minimal Hyprland rice.

DEPENDENCIES:

- Hyprland
- hypridle
- hyprlock
- hyprsunset
- hyprshot
- hyprpicker
- hyprpolkitagent
- nm-applet
- swaybg
- waybar
- rofi
- swaync
- Rosé Pine GTK theme, and a theme manager like nwg-look
- Kvantum (for Qt programs)

This SHOULD be just about everything, but I probably missed something, let me know if anything doesn't work!

NOTE: I have only tested this on Arch Linux, so I don't know if any code will be different on older versions of the software needed for this rice (for example, on Debian).
